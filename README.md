# Toxicity Prediction

A machine learning project for predicting molecular toxicity using both classical DeepChem baselines and advanced Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), aiming to reduce the need for animal testing in lab experiments.

---

## Overview

This repository contains multiple approaches to molecular toxicity prediction, focusing on the Tox21 dataset. It includes:

-  Baseline DeepChem models
-  GNN-based models using PyTorch Geometric
-  Advanced GNNs with enriched features
- ðŸ”œ Utility scripts for feature engineering, training, and evaluation
- ðŸ”œ Pretrained models for inference
